In this project, we will be working with hash tables. A hash table is a data scructure for efficient storage, lookup, insertion, and deletion of key/value pairs. The address of an element to be stored in a hash table is directly derived from the element's key using a predetermined hashing algorithm. In this project we are focusing on the 'hash_djb2' algorithm and chaining for collision handling.
